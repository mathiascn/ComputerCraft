### Steps to Install via Pastebin:

1. **Fix pastebin module**
   - The built-in pastebin module is outdated and needs a fix to work with the current pastebin api. 
   - Open shell on master computer
   - Copy and run this code: `local r = http.get("https://pastebin.com/raw/XzH1gK2e"); local f = fs.open(shell.resolve( "pastebin" ), "w"); f.write(r.readAll()); f.close(); r.close();`

2. **Upload Scripts to Pastebin**:
   - If you havenâ€™t already, upload each script to Pastebin and note the unique hash provided for each script.

3. **Download Scripts in ComputerCraft**:
   - Open the terminal in your turtle or computer in Minecraft.
   - Use the `pastebin get` command followed by the unique code for the script you want to download.
   
   Example:
   ```lua
   pastebin get <hash> <name>
   ```

4. **Run the Script**:
   - Once the script is downloaded, you can run it directly from the terminal:
   ```lua
   farmer <args>
   ```
